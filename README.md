# minil
a miniature scripting language [EN] - un langage de script miniature [FR]


this [`minil` project](https://github.com/bstarynk/minil) was written (in French) for inspiration to
[J.Pitrat](http://bootstrappingartificialintelligence.fr/WordPress3/)
and is now, in 2019, abandonned, but
[bismon](https://github.com/bstarynk/bismon) shares most ideas of
`minil` and is still (in 2019) alive.

J.Pitrat passed away on october 2019.
